# Use Case Diagram (UCD)

**In the scope of this project, there is a direct relationship of _1 to 1_ between Use Cases (UC) and User Stories (US).**

However, be aware, this is a pedagogical simplification. On further projects and curricular units might also exist \_1 to N **and/or** N to 1 relationships between US and UC.

**Insert below the Use Case Diagram in a SVG format**

**For each UC/US, it must be provided evidences of applying main activities of the software development process (requirements, analysis, design, tests and code). Gather those evidences on a separate file for each UC/US and set up a link as suggested below.**
