# OO Analysis

The construction process of the domain model is based on the client specifications, especially the nouns (for _
concepts_) and verbs (for _relations_) used.

## Rationale to identify domain conceptual classes

To identify domain conceptual classes, start by making a list of candidate conceptual classes inspired by the list of
categories suggested in the book "Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and
Iterative Development".

| Category                                           | Candidate classes                                                                         |

### **Rationale to identify associations between conceptual classes**###

An association is a relationship between instances of objects that indicates a relevant connection and that is worth of
remembering, or it is derivable from the List of Common Associations:

- **_A_** is physically or logically part of **_B_**
- **_A_** is physically or logically contained in/on **_B_**
- **_A_** is a description for **_B_**
- **_A_** known/logged/recorded/reported/captured in **_B_**
- **_A_** uses or manages or owns **_B_**
- **_A_** is related with a transaction (item) of **_B_**
- etc.
